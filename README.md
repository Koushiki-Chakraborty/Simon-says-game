## Simon Says Game
##  About the Project
Welcome to Simon Says Game, a fun and interactive web-based game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project is designed to challenge your memory and focus, while also showcasing my web development skills. It has been an incredible opportunity to apply what I've learned and explore the exciting intersection of logic, creativity, and design.

## How It Works
The Simon Says Game tests your memory by presenting a sequence of lights that you must replicate. Here’s a quick overview of how the game works:
1. Gameboard Interaction: A grid lights up in a specific sequence. Your goal is to remember and replicate the pattern.
2. Player Turn: Click on the buttons in the correct order to match the sequence.
3. Increasing Difficulty: With each successful round, the sequence grows longer, making the game more challenging.
4. End Game: The game ends when you click in the wrong order. Try to beat your previous record!
It’s a simple yet addictive game perfect for players of all ages.

## Features
1. Interactive Gameplay: Vibrant colors and smooth animations for a seamless user experience.
2. Dynamic Sequencing: Each round generates a new random sequence for a unique challenge every time.
3. Responsive Design: Fully functional across different devices and screen sizes.
